Despite the blockchain's foundational principles of eliminating intermediaries and distributing authority, current trends exhibit concentrations in mining power, wealth, and decision-making. Mitigating centralization is imperative to address security risks and ensure fairness in the blockchain.
This project addresses the prevailing issue of centralization within the blockchain ecosystem by proposing a comprehensive solution for visualizing the degree of decentralization across various networks. 

Existing visualization tools primarily cater to Bitcoin, leaving a gap for other major chains like Ethereum, Ripple, and Polygon. This project aims to fill this void by conducting layer-by-layer analyses of decentralization aspects, identifying measurable metrics, and utilizing tools like Tableau for data visualization. The proposed web application, employing technologies such as React will provide interactive dashboards displaying decentralization metrics, offering a nuanced perspective on the state of decentralization across diverse blockchain networks.
